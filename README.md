# Freelancer Assignment & CPM Scheduler

This project automates two important project-management steps:
1. Assigning freelancers to tasks using the Hungarian Algorithm  
2. Scheduling tasks using the Critical Path Method (CPM)

The system helps choose the best freelancer for each task based on skill, experience, and cost, and then builds a complete project schedule with the critical path highlighted.
